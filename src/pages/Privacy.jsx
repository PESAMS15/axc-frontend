WHAT INFORMATION
WE HAVE &
WHERE WE GET IT
When you create an account and buy tickets. When you create an account, buy a ticket, register for a presale or have a ticket transferred to you by a friend, we will collect information directly from you. Depending on the service we are providing, this may include your contact and billing information, such as your name, street address, zip or post code, email, phone number and credit card.
When you buy tickets from third parties. Where you buy tickets from third-party e-commerce sites, the third party will send us information such as your contact and billing information and information about your ticket purchase for us to allocate tickets to you.
When using our websites and apps. When you use our websites or apps, we may use tracking tools like browser cookies and web beacons and technology like GPS and Wi-Fi to passively collect data about you, such as the browser and device you're using, your IP address, your location, the site you came from, what you did and didn't use our site/app for, or the site you visit when you leave us. For more information on how we collect this information, see our Cookie Policy
When you contact our fan experience and customer support teams. When you contact our Customer Services teams with a query or provide us with feedback, we record that interaction for evidentiary purposes and to provide support related to your query.
When you use social media and online public forums. When you use a social media feature within our website or apps, post to social media platforms, or post on a public space or on one of our websites, the social media site may provide us with some information about you.
When you book accessible tickets. If you have accessibility requirements, we want to make sure you have the best experience when attending events. To do this, we need to collect details of your requirements. We only do this once, with your requirements then on record for the next time you come back to purchase an accessible ticket.
When you sell a ticket on Ticketmaster. As we are transferring money to you, we need to collect information such as a valid ID as part of our Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. Once your identity has been verified, we securely delete this information. We may also collect information from you when you use our services as a seller, including additional identification data such as tax identification numbers.
Geodemographic data. We might collect or use suppliers such as advertising and marketing partners who collate geodemographic data such as age range, gender, or information about events you like or products you buy, which assists us in better personalising our services to you. If you’d prefer that we do not do this, see the ‘Your Rights & Choices’ section below.
Fan images and CCTV. When attending an event at a venue or festival we collect your image and likeness. This might be through CCTV cameras or videographers, photographers on-site. This is primarily collected for the safety and security of our fans; however, we sometimes use these images in our marketing or social media posts. If you wish to object to images being used for marketing visit the ‘Your Rights & Choices’ section below.
Onsite safeguarding when attending an event. To provide a safe and secure event site we may process personal information to be able to enforce appropriate access management, confirm a person’s purpose for being onsite, or for any issues that may arise.

Information used for health/safety purposes. We may collect information from ticket purchasers and attendees for compliance purposes related to infectious disease to the extent required under applicable law. This information may include names, contact details, seat locations, along with entry and exit times.
In situations where a third party for an event organizer requires the collection of health information (such as test results), please refer to their privacy policy and terms to understand how your data was collected and used.

HOW WE USE YOUR
INFORMATION & WHY
This section explains how we use your information and the legal grounds/purposes for which we use it.

For the performance of our contract with you
When you make purchases. We use your information when you enter a contract or transaction with us (for example to buy merchandise or a ticket) so we can:
process your order
send you customer service emails including booking confirmations and event reminders
take payment
provide you with customer support.
Event Partner(s). To share with Event Partner(s) who provide services for the event such as the Promoter or Venue to enable them to run the event, allocate seating or notify you if there has been a change to the event or provide important event information.
Verified Fan. Some of our events have Verified Fan presale. If you enter, we process your data to profile you to limit fraudulent ticket purchases. You don’t have to enter Verified Fan and if you are rejected, it won’t stop you from purchasing tickets at a later date. For full FAQs around how your data is used during the Verified Fan process see our Verified Fan FAQ’s fo North America or International
Contest, Competitions and Referrals. We may use your information to confirm your registration for an event or contest. You may give us your friend's information, for example via our referral service to tell a friend about our website or to purchase a gift card. We will only use your friend's information to provide services you requested. Your friend may contact us to ask us to delete their information.
For our legitimate business interests
Marketing. To contact you with information or offers regarding upcoming events, products or services (applicable to markets that rely on legitimate interest) this may be via email, via push and web notifications, via SMS, or social media platforms. You can change your marketing preferences at any time, see Your Rights & Choices section below.
Advertising & cookies. To deliver tailored advertising and marketing communications on our websites and apps depending on your market. (see our Cookie Policy for more information).
Market research & fan feedback. To conduct market research and analysis which helps improve and customise our products and services and to contact you with satisfaction surveys, or to participate in user research (such as focus groups). We include an unsubscribe option for this kind of contact should you no longer wish to receive them.
Personalisation. To make sure our messages and website are relevant to you (depending on your market). For example, when you ‘favourite’ certain artists and genres, purchase tickets, attend shows with friends and sign up for presales, we will inform you about similar events we think you might be interested in. We create a user profile with the information we have and how you use our services. By turning personalisation off you won’t get any personal recommendations and any newsletters you’ve subscribed to will be generic (although if you’ve asked to receive alerts about specific artists or venues, you’ll still receive these).
We will still perform profiling activities where we need to so we can deliver our services to you, for example for fraud screening purposes and where you specifically request we do so such as for a Verified Fan Presale.

For our overriding legitimate business interests
To prevent or detect unlawful behaviour, to protect or enforce our legal rights or as otherwise permitted by law. For example, making sure tickets get into the hands of real fans. As such, we may use your information to prevent ticket touting, misuse of our intellectual property (e.g. our or our Event Partner's brands), fraud, or other crimes.

Event security. To protect our fans and ensure the security of our and our Event Partners’ operations.
